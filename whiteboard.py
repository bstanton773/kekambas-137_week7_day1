# Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. 
# The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized 
# (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). 
# The next words should be always capitalized.

# Examples
# "the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
# "The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"
# "lets_go_team" gets converted to "letsGoTeam"
